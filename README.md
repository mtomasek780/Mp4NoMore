# MP4NoMore
Thanks to the h264ify team for most of the code in this project to start.  If you just have issues with Youtube playing in Chrome, Vivaldi and/or Firefox then check out their project at https://github.com/erkserkserks/h264ify

# About
Mp4NoMore is Chrome compatible, but primarily for Vivaldi users, that allows Late Model Macs that cannot use MP4 and are met with the dreaded "This media cannot be played" message to be able to stop offering web servers the ability to send mp4 to your Mac and instead defer to vp8, vp9, and webm to still allow the user a good experience until the Vivaldi Dev team can address the issue in the future.

# Requirements
This is meant for Vivaldi Browser, but works with Google Chrome


# Installation
Feel free to install it by cloning and then enabling development mode in your extensions.  I will be bundling and publishing to the Chrome store soon.
