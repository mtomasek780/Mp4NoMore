# MP4NoMore
Thanks to the h264ify team for most of the code in this project to start.  If you just have issues with Youtube playing in Chrome/Vivaldi and/or Firefox, check out there project at https://github.com/erkserkserks/h264ify

# About
Mp4NoMoreis Chrome compatabile, but primarily for Vivaldi users, extension allows Late Model macs that cannot use MP4 and are met with the dreaded "This media cannot be played" message to be able to stop offering web servers the ability to send mp4 and instead defer to vp8, vp9, and webm instead to still allow the user a good experience until the Vivaldi Dev team can address the issue in the future.

# Requirements
This is meant for Vivaldi Browser, but works with Google Chrome


# Installation
Coming soon...
